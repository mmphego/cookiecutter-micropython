# Quickstart

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):
```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Generate a Python package project:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/mmphego/cookiecutter-micropython.git
```

Then:

-   Create a repo and put it there.
-   Run `make bootstrap`
-   Upload your uPython implementation to your microchip
-   `make upload`

For more details, see the [cookiecutter-pypackage
tutorial](https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).


### Fork This / Create Your Own

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork
this to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly
have to be a fork.

-   Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar
    Cookiecutter Templates list above with a brief description.
-   It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do
    whatever you think sounds good.

### Or Submit a Pull Request

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if
they make my own packaging experience better.
